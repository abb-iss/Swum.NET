<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The program <B>srcml2src</B> translates from the XML
source-code representation srcML into source code. The srcML
format allows for XML addressing, querying, and transformation of
source code. The srcML format for a source-code file is typically
produced by <B>src2srcml</B>.
<P>

The combination of <B>src2srcml</B> and
<B>srcml2src</B> allows for full round-trip
transformation of source-code files without any loss of comments,
white space, and preprocessing statements.
<P>

Conversion from the srcML format to source code is relatively
straightforward. All XML tags are removed and escaped characters
are unescaped. Special srcML elements for characters not
permitted in XML, e.g., formfeed, are converted back to their
original characters.
<P>

In addition to conversion, <B>srcml2src</B> provides
various srcML utilities such as extracting metadata, extracting
individual files in a srcML archive (as either text or XML),
and extracting metadata from individual files in a srcML archive.
It can also be used to extract all the individual files in
a srcML archive.
<P>

Further, <B>srcml2src</B> allows for querying srcML
using XPath expressions and RelaxNG, and transformation using
XLST. With a srcML archive, a query/transformation is applied
individually to each file and the results combined. This allows
the XPath, XSLT, or RelaxNG to work efficiently on large srcML
documents that contain all of the source code in a large project.
<P>

Using the character - in the place of an input srcML file filename
uses standard input, and in place of an output source-code file
uses standard output.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h, --help</B><DD>
Output the help and exit.
<DT><B>-V, --version</B><DD>
Output the version of srcml2src and exit.
<DT><B>-t, --src-encoding=</B><I>encoding</I><DD>
Sets the encoding used for the output text source-code files
to <I>encoding</I>. The default is --ISO-8859-1.
<DT><B>-U, --unit=</B><I>number</I><DD>
Refers to a specific file in a srcML archive.
The numbering starts at 1. If the number is outside of the
range of nested units then nothing is returned. In
combination with the attribute flags, outputs the attribute
of that particular unit. In combination with the <B>--xml</B> option
outputs the unit in xml (not as text as is the default).
<DT><B>-a, --to-dir</B><DD>
Extracts all files from a srcML archive back into
source-code files. The file path is based on the
attributes "directory"
and "filename" with necessary
subdirectories created. Existing files with the same path
are overwritten.
<DT><B>-X, --xml</B><DD>
Output is in srcML format. Used in combination with the
<B>--unit</B> option to output a particular
nested unit in XML. The attributes on the output element "unit" are
the attributes of the individual unit with any missing attributes
taken from the root unit.
<DT><B>-z, --compress</B><DD>
Output is in compressed gzip format.
<DT><B>--no-xml-declaration</B><DD>
No output of the default XML declaration for XML output options.
Useful when the output is to be placed inside another XML document.
<DT><B>--no-namespace-decl</B><DD>
No output of namespace declarations for XML output options.
Useful when the output is to be placed inside another XML document.
<DT><B>-v, --verbose</B><DD>
Verbose output to standard error.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>METADATA OPTIONS</H2>

Options to access to the metadata stored in the
srcML document. Unless otherwise noted, the metadata is quickly extracted
from the start root element or the XML declaration and does not
traverse the entire document. Output is to standard output.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-l, --language</B><DD>
Output the language of the srcML file as stored in the
attribute "language" in the element "unit".
The language is the value of the attribute of the root
element, or for a particular unit if specified with the
<B>--unit</B> option.
<DT><B>-d, --directory</B><DD>
Output the directory of the srcML file as stored in the
attribute "dir" in the element "unit". The
directory is the value of the attribute of the root
element, or for a particular unit if specified with the
<B>--unit</B> option.
<DT><B>-f, --filename</B><DD>
Output the filename of the srcML file as stored in the
attribute "filename" in the element "unit".
The filename is the value of the attribute of the root
element, or for a particular unit if specified with the
<B>--unit</B> option.
<DT><B>-s, --src-version</B><DD>
Output the version of the srcML file as stored attribute
"version" in the element "unit". The version
is the value of the attribute of the root
element, or for a particular unit if specified with the
<B>--unit</B> option.
<DT><B>-p, --prefix=</B><I>uri</I><DD>
Output the prefix of the namespace given by uri. The name of
the prefix is output with a newline character. The default
namespace is a blank line. If the URI does not match a
namespace declaration then no line is output.
<DT><B>-n, --units</B><DD>
Output the number of nested units in a srcML archive.
Result is 0 for a srcML file that is not an archive.
Requires traversal of the entire document.
<DT><B>-i, --info</B><DD>
Output most of the metadata of the srcML file. Each
individual piece of data, i.e., namespaces, encoding,
language, directory, filename, and version, is on a separate
line. The form of the information is that same as that of
the full flag option to src2srcml to form it, without the
leading &quot;--&quot;.
<DT><B>-L, --longinfo</B><DD>
Output the metadata of the <B>--info</B>
option along with the count of the nested files in a
srcML archive. Requires traversal of the entire srcML document.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>QUERYING AND TRANSFORMATION OPTIONS</H2>

Options for efficiently querying and transformation srcML.
Standalone XML tools that are DOM based (XPath, XSLT) have large memory requirements with large
srcML files. The <B>srcml2src</B> options work efficiently with large srcML
archives that contain large numbers of files in a project, e.g., tens
of thousands of files for a project in a single 1 GB srcML archive 1 GB.
All queries/transformations are performed on a unit
by unit basis inside the srcML archive.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--xpath=</B><I>xpath</I><DD>
Apply the XPath expression <I>xpath</I> to each individual unit in the
srcML archive and combine the results of the individual queries.
<P>
To refer to elements standard srcML prefixes (see <B>srcml2src</B>) are used.
One exception is that prefix &quot;src&quot; is used for srcML elements, e.g., "src:unit".
Note that these prefixes do not have to match the prefixes used in the document.
<P>
If the result of the expression is anything other then a set of nodes the
individual unit results are combined. For numeric results, e.g., counts,
the final result is the sum of the individual results. For boolean values,
the result is the logical "or" of the individual results.
<P>
The output is a srcML archive with each XPath expression
result in its own individual
element "unit". If the XPath expression
does not result in a element "unit", one is
wrapped around the result. This format allows for pipelines of
queries and transformations.
<DT><B>--xslt=</B><I>xslt_file</I><DD>
Apply the XSLT program <I>xslt_file</I> to each individual unit in a
srcML archive and combine the results of the individual transformations.
<P>
The XSLT program can use any part of XSLT 1.0, and many EXSLT extension functions.
Since the XSLT program doesn't have access to some information on the entire archive, the program
is passed a series of internally generated parameters. The parameters
src:filename, src:directory, src:version, and src:language are the corresponding
entries from the root element "unit".
The parameter
src:position is the position of an individual unit in the root unit, e.g., the
position of the file in the entire srcML archive. Parameters can also be
passed to the XSLT program from the <B>srcml2src</B> command line.
<P>
The output is a srcML document with the combined results of the XSLT transformation
wrapped in an outer element "unit" thereby providing an output format that allows
for repeated application.
<DT><B>--xpathparam </B><I>parameter_name</I><B> </B><I>parameter_value</I><DD>
Pass the parameter <I>parameter_name</I> and its corresponding
<I>parameter_value</I> to the XSLT transformation.
This is only valid with the <B>--xslt</B> option.
This is analagous to the --xpathparam of xsltproc. The xsltproc limit of 32
parameters applies here.
Note that the internally generated parameters src:filename, src:directory, src:version,
src:language, and src:position are automatically generated and are not part
of the 32 parameter limit.
<DT><B>--relaxng=</B><I>relaxng_file</I><DD>
Apply the RelaxNG grammar <I>relaxng_file</I> to each individual unit in the
srcML archive and combine the parts that match.
<P>
The RelaxNG grammar acts as a filter for individual units
(files). If the RelaxNG gramar is valid for a unit, then
that unit is output. The result is a srcML archive with
only the files that are valid based on the given RelaxNG
grammar.
